> Helper functions for SailThru to enable local code development with live syncing and the ability to send tests to several recipients with ease.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Setup
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:
```sh
SAILTHRU_API_KEY=your_api_key
SAILTHRU_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

For different SailThru environment, you can create a .env file for each. For example: ```dev.env```

## Usage

```sh 
node sail [--env=dev]
```

This will start the CLI and you will be prompted to select an option.

### 



## Features

### Live Syncing
When code is pushed or pulled you will have the option to sync the code to the SailThru server every time the file is saved. This lets you work on HTML + Zephyr code with the setup and all the tools you are used to without having to manually upload each time.

### Github Copilot 
If you use Github Copilot, this tool is even better. Copilot is able to assist in writing the Zephyr code for SailThru, but has limited success so always check the outputs.
